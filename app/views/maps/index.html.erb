<h2>About</h2>
<p>This is a map for people to pin the location of their projects. It's a bit late, since it would've been most effective when people were still unsure what they were working on, but oh well.</p>
<p>Double-click where your group is working, fill out your info, and go. To help you orient yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blue: windows</li>
<li>Orange: elevators</li>
<li>Green: food table</li>
<li>Random squares: rough outlines of masses of people</li>
<li>North is to the right, if you're like that</li>
</ul>

<h2>NOTE!!!</h2>

<p>This app is really brittle: it doesn't do auth of any kind, so you can delete what ever you want. I'm relying on you guys not to be dicks, so I can do something I want to do rather than deal with random crap.</p>

<p>It updates every 15 seconds or so, so you don't have to constantly refresh. Hooray! :D (It doesn't load underlying map changes, but that's okay, since it shouldn't happen often)</p>
