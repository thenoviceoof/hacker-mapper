HackNY Hacker-finder

----------------------------------------

Made originally for HackNY 2010, it was conceived as a way to let people see what groups were doing, and where they could find them. I finished the app way too late for the app to have any impact whatsoever, but I hope that you can use this code as a base for future hackathon hacker maps.
