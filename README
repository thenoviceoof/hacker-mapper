HackNY Hacker-finder

----------------------------------------

Made originally for HackNY 2010, it was conceived as a way to let people see what groups were doing, and where they could find them. I finished the app way too late for the app to have any impact whatsoever, but I hope that you can use this code as a base for future hackathon hacker maps.

Last tested with:

Rails 2.2.3, Ubuntu 10.10 - at the Spring 2011 HackNY
